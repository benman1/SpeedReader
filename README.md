# SpeedReader

So far reads epub files and presents the text in a given chapter with a given speed. Keyboard commands are as follows:
* pause - space bar
* rewind - left
* forward - right
* faster - period (other keys like plus don't seem to work)
* slower - minus or comma
* n - next chapter
* p - previous chapter

Compile in maven. Give command line arguments for book, speed and chapter.

Pull requests appreciated.
